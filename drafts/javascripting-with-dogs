javascript is fun and all, but javascripting with dogs is way more interesting. in this tutorial, i'll go over the basics of javascript, but add in some cute pups along the way. 

###setting a variable 
var dog = 'homer'
<img src= "homer.jpg"> </img>
var puppy = 'plato'
<img src= "plato.jpg" </img>
console.log(dog + ' loves ' + puppy) // 'homer loves plato'
<img src= "homerandplato.jpg"</img>

##arrays
var dogs = ['homer', 'plato]
console.log(dogs[0] + ' loves ' + dogs[1]) // 'homer loves plato'

##objects in arrays 
var dogs = [{name: 'homer', age: 5}, {name: 'Plato', age: 6}]
console.log('The dogs are ' + dogs[0].age ' and ' + dogs[1].age) // 'The dogs are 5 and 6'

## the foreach loop
var dogs = var dogs = [{name: 'homer', age: 5}, {name: 'Plato', age: 6}]
dogs.forEach(function(dog) {
  console.log(dog.breed)
}


##the push method
var dogs = var dogs = [{name: 'homer', age: 5}, {name: 'Plato', age: 6}]
var ages = []
