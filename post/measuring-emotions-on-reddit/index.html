<p>In order to analyze human emotion in social networks, I used sentiment analysis on comments from the 50 top subreddits. In this post, you&#39;ll see how I parsed through reddit&#39;s somewhat messy API, and found the sum sentiment scores for the top 50 subreddits. </p>
<p>Reddit, is more than just a place to get updated on worldnews, look at cute pictures of puppies, and hear about the latest edition of world of warcraft. Reddit has become a community where millions of people gather every day to view and post their thoughts, opinions, and views on thousands of different topics. Reddit has a straightforward JSON API; access a JSON representation of any page by appending &#39;.json&#39; to the URL. Here is a comment taken from the subreddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/3a1cba/this_is_ollie_hes_ready_for_business">aww</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/img/messy.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>I parsed the API, taking out the relevant information needed for my analysis. Here is a sample of my cleaned-up json:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cleanjson.jpg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<hr>
<p>With my new easy to navigate json, I ran a sentiment analysis test on all of the comments of each post on each subreddit. Sentiment, created by <a href="https://github.com/thisandagain">@thisandagain</a>, is a Node.js modulue that uses a preset worldlist, where each block of test is scored based on the negative or positive value of each word. Below is an example of how the sentiment analysis works:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;You&#39;re dad is adorable and I want to adopt him.&quot; -Score: 5
&quot;It is incredible how many idiots are around us. 
Reddit is an idiot magnet&quot; -Score: -3
</code></pre><p>Sometimes, the sentiment scores can be off, due to sentiment&#39;s failure to understand context, as seen below:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Holy fuck. That&#39;s like weaponized cuteness right there.&quot; 
Score: -2
</code></pre><p>However, by examining thousands of comments, the sum score pretty much averages out. </p>
<hr>
<p>Aside from the easy to access API, I chose to anaylyze reddit because it covers such a broad range of topics, and is utilized by such a wide range of people. I performed the analysis on the top 50 subreddits. </p>
<p>This graph shows the sum sentiment scores of the top 50 subreddits from negative to positive. </p>

<p>As you can see, the subreddit &quot;IAmA&quot; has the highest sum sentiment scores. With the &quot;I Am A&quot; subreddit, users post what they do in life, and people can comment, ask questions, ect. The subreddit with the most negative sum sentiment score was &quot;AskReddit&quot;, where users can ask reddit anything. </p>

<p>After analyzing the top 50 subreddits, I looked into contrasting subreddits.</p>

<p>Finally, I analyzed the top 25 U.S. cities. The top 25 cities ranked according to population and rank respectively include: </p>

<hr>
<p>After analyzing the sum subreddit scores, I wanted to look more into what kind of posts were contained in each subreddit. </p>
<h2 id="highlight-subreddits">Highlight Subreddits</h2>
<h4 id="news">News</h4>
<p><a href= "http://downingherlocker.github.io/measuring-emotions-on-reddit/news.html"> Here </a> you can see the sentiment scores for each post in the news subreddit</p>
